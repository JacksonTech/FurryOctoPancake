I am proud to release the results of my eight-day game programming challenge, and my first VR game in Unity for Google Cardboard: Furry Octo Pancake.

In this short exploration game, you (a detective) must investigate a missing persons report in a high tech, futuristic city. Requires Google Cardboard to play.

The game is open source; I hope other developers find it useful! My code and assets are released under the Apache 2.0 License; some of the other assets have their own licenses (CC-BY, CC-BY-SA) and these licenses are noted in the NOTICE file.

You can check out my devlog posts on making this game at my blog:
